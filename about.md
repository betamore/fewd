Learn how to build and launch a website from start to finish in this 8-week course. The Front-End Web Development (FEWD) course at [Betamore](https://betamore.com) is a great starting point for tech entrepreneurs who want to build their own products, marketers who would like to build their own landing pages, project managers who want to better understand their development team, or career switchers looking to test the waters with coding and web development.

Whether you've never touched a website or maybe done a little dabbling in Wordpress, you'll learn the basics of web development and the fundamentals of building things for the web. Topics covered include HTML, CSS, JS, responsive web design, version control, optimization, deployment, APIs, and more.

Throughout the course we'll work on small exercises to help solidify concepts, as well as tackle some [projects](/projects) that you can add to your portfolio.
